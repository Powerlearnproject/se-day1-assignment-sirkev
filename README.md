#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

     Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It is a systematic and disciplined approach to software development that aims to create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software.
    
    1. Software engineering includes a variety of techniques, tools, and methodologies, including requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance.
    2. It is a rapidly evolving field, and new tools and technologies are constantly being developed to improve the software development process.
    3. By following the principles of software engineering and using the appropriate tools and methodologies, software developers can create high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software that meets the needs of  its users.
    4. Software Engineering is mainly used for large projects based on software systems rather than single programs or applications.
    5. The main goal of Software Engineering is to develop software applications for improving quality,  budget, and time efficiency.
    6. Software Engineering ensures that the software that has to be built should be consistent, correct, also on budget, on time, and within the required requirements.

       
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    
    1. The first compiler: The invention of the first compiler in the 1950s marked a significant milestone in the evolution of software engineering. The compiler allowed for the automated translation of high-level languages into machine code,which greatly increased the speed and efficiency of software development.
    2. The development of the first integrated development environment (IDE): The advent of IDEs in the 1980s further revolutionized software engineering. IDEs provide a comprehensive set of tools and features that enhance productivity and  streamline the software development process. They include features like code completion, debugging tools, and version control systems.
    3. The rise of agile methodologies: The emergence of agile methodologies in the 1990s represents another significant milestone in software engineering. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emphasize collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. They have revolutionized the software development industry by enabling faster and more iterative development cycles.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting users needs
    2. Design Designing of the software architecture
    3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software
    4. Testing : Conducting various test  to ensure the software meets the starndards
    5. Deployment : releasing the software to the user
    6. Providing maintenance support such as updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

     Agile methods are iterative approach focused on flexibility , collaboration and responding to change while waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

    A Software Developer is responsible for designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. This involves writing code, debugging, and testing software, as well as collaborating with other developers to identify and fix errors.
    
    A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for developing and implementing testing protocols to ensure that software systems meet the required standards. This involves creating test cases, executing tests, and reporting defects to developers.
    
    A Project Manager is responsible for overseeing the entire software development process. This involves planning, coordinating, and controlling the project lifecycle, including setting schedules, allocating resources, and managing budgets. The Project Manager is also responsible for ensuring that the project is delivered on time, within budget, and meets the required quality standards.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

    IDE is a tool that helps in writing, testing, debugging and testing code eg. visual studio code and VCS is  important because it tracks changes made to code and helps in co-ordinating work among team members.eg. git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

    1. Tight deadlines: Communicate effectively with stakeholders, manage time effectively, and prioritize tasks.
    2. Changing requirements: Be flexible and adaptable, and have a clear understanding of the project vision and requirements.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

    Unit testing is the process of testing individual units of code, such as functions or methods, to ensure that they behave as expected.
    Integration testing is the process of testing integrated code units to ensure that they work together as expected.
    System testing: is the process of testing a complete software system to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. Acceptance testing is the process of testing a software system to ensure that it meets the user's acceptance criteria. Testing is important in software quality assurance because it helps to identify and fix errors, and to ensure that the software meets the specified requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing natural language prompts to get the desired response from an AI model. It is important in interacting with AI models because it helps to clearly communicate the request and get the desired response.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

    Vague prompt: Create an image of a man with tattoos?
    Improved prompt: Create a Potrait single subject of a man with detailed image set of a man's body displaying tattoos, presented from three angles: front view, side view, and back view. The tattoos are bold and intricate, covering various areas such as the arms, chest, back, and shoulders. The designs include a mix of traditional and modern styles, with a combination of black and color inks. The man's skin tone is natural, and the tattoos should be clearly defined and seamlessly integrated with the body. The background is simple and neutral to maintain the focus on the tattoo artwork.
